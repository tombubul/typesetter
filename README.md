# typesetter
lightweight tool for javascript typesetting from a png character set

# What is this?
In March 2020 Bryan & Julia asked me to do some lettering for a print project they're putting together for their wedding. Rather than just do the lettering directly, I decided to make a custom typeset and a tool to use to print the lettering they requested from that. This repo starts there.
